# merge-sort-and-count-python
This is a program for sorting input arrays of numbers and counting the split inversions (second part hasn't implemented).

This code was implemented using the book [1]. This code uses Divide and Conquer algorithm, which called Merge Sort to sort an array of input numbers. The result of sorting prints to the output file. It is also assumed, that it must be count number of split inversions, but for some reasons this part of code was not implemented.
If you would like, you can implement this part of the code yourself.
